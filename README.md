This project is my first webpage.
It contains links to 4 other html files, a link to a video on youtube and three images.
There is also a table and a list.
This project was meant to practice with lists, tables, styling, using links, using bootstrap and making buttons.
The webpage is kind of about ducks but contains little information about them.
There is a seperate file called styles.css for the styling.
there are 4 seperate html files for either an image or a link to a video.
There is also a scss file called variables.
